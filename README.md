What is ansible
```
Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It allows users to define and manage **infrastructure as code,** enabling them to automate repetitive tasks, streamline complex workflows, and ensure consistency across multiple servers or devices.
```

What is Vagrant 
```
Vagrant is an open-source tool for building and managing virtualized development environments. It provides a command-line interface to configure and deploy reproducible virtualized environments on various platforms, such as VirtualBox, VMware, and others.
```


### 1. **Enable Nested Virtualization in the VMware Host (Outer VM):**

- Ensure that your VMware host (the outer VM) allows nested virtualization. This setting is often referred to as "Expose hardware-assisted virtualization to the guest OS" or something similar in VMware settings. It might be found in the virtual machine settings under the "Processor" or "CPU" section

  VT-x (Virtualization Technology for x86) is an Intel processor technology that provides hardware-assisted virtualization. It's a crucial feature in nested virtualization scenarios where you run a virtual machine (VM) inside another VM. (Click the small tick box in VMWare) 
```


### Step 2: Add VirtualBox Directory to PATH
To add the `VBoxManage` binary to the `PATH` environmental variable, you need to find the directory where VirtualBox is installed and then add that directory to your `PATH`. Here are the general steps:
Once you've identified the directory containing `VBoxManage`, you can add it to the `PATH`:

#### On Linux:

```bash
which VBoxManage 

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/VBoxManage
```

```

### [13 Lets play](https://github.com/quincyntuli/GOAD-v2-Installation-Notes#13-lets-play)

First, we let vagrant setup the 5 instances. The ISO will be downloaded and the VMs will be setup. If a local copy of the .iso already exists then this download part will be skipped and the machine will be imported from the .iso and built.

```shell
cd ad/GOAD/providers/virtualbox
vagrant up
```

At this stage the instructions tell us to play the plabook for all playbooks by executing

```shell
ansible-playbook main.yml
```

My recommendation is to play the individuals plays books one by one to give each VM a chance to complete the build process so as to respond properly to the next set of tasks for each playbook.

As copied from the official github, those steps are ...

```
cd ansible/
ansible-playbook -i ../ad/GOAD/data/inventory -i ../ad/GOAD/providers/virtualbox/inventory main.yml


Or individually folloing the list below. However you can just keep running the main.yml file and all errors will eventually be fixed. 

ansible-playbook -i ../ad/GOAD/data/inventory -i ../ad/GOAD/providers/virtualbox/inventory servers.yml


```shell
ansible-playbook build.yml        # Install stuff and prepare vm
ansible-playbook ad-servers.yml   # create main domains, child domain and enroll servers
ansible-playbook ad-trusts.yml    # create the trust relationships
ansible-playbook ad-data.yml      # import the ad datas : users/groups...
ansible-playbook servers.yml      # Install IIS and MSSQL
ansible-playbook ad-relations.yml # set the rights and the group domains relations
ansible-playbook adcs.yml         # Install ADCS on essos
ansible-playbook ad-acl.yml       # set the ACE/ACL
ansible-playbook security.yml     # Configure some securities (adjust av enable/disable)
ansible-playbook vulnarabilities.yml # Configure some vulnerabilities
```

```shell

When you finish playing you could do :

vagrant halt # will stop all the vm

To just relaunch the lab (no need to replay ansible as you already do that in the first place)

vagrant up   #Â will start the lab

```
